## Project Description:
In epidemic disasters like Ebola, governments struggle to determine where to deploy treatment centers, under constraints imposed by time, funds and availability of doctors. We visualize the current state of the epidemic on a map, and use deep learning to predict its future development. Given very early signs of an outbreak, our model is able to extrapolate the spread over time. Government officials can then add treatment centers to the map and observe how the disease would develop based on the placement of treatment centers. Our application provides response teams with an intuitive visualization and modeling tool that allows them to make faster and more informed decisions.
